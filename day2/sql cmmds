stored procedure is a prepared sql stt that once coded can be reused again and again, single sp can be used over the network by several users and we all can be using different input data, also reduce network traffic and increase the performance & if we modify the sp, anyone who's using the stored procedure will get update.
simple ex:
 create procedure test as 
 select*from user_master
 
 to execute the stored procedure run
 
 exec test
